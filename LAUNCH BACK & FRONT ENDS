Backend

    Data is stored locally in a MySQL database
    Go to the Sails project API folder (on local, sails-student-api)
    Launch Sails: sails lift
    This will start the Student API listening on port 3700

    NOTE: As long as the data is compatible, you can modify the baseurl in data.service.ts: private baseUrl = 'http://localhost:1337/'

    So a request to get the students is http://localhost:1337/student

Frontend

    The frontend is pure Angular 5
    Locally, Angular project folder and perform: ng serve --open
    When you receive the "webpack: Compiled successfully." message the server is up
    A window will open in the default browser showing the landing page
