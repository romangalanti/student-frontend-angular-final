# 2018-6-8: Styled Delete Confirm Component

# 2018-7-19: Injected ID number into the Delete Confirm Component

# 2018-7-23: Included a string along with the id in the Delete Confirm Component so the popup could include a descriptor of what's being deleted and not just an id number.

The .subscribe() function is similar to the .then() function in jQuery, but instead of dealing with promises it deals with Observables.
